Nginx+certbot : easy script to generate TLS certificate for a dns and run nginx in a container to reverse proxy a webapp over https

## Usage

:warning: Edit the nginx conf files and docker-compose.yaml to fit to your needs, and remove dummy example files and as well as its certificate directory.

To use this tool, you must have a dns pointing to a server to which you have access.
Run this script on that server:

```
❯  ./generate_tls.certificate.sh
```

## Demo

```bash
❯ cd /tmp
❯ git clone https://github.com/TommyStarK/easy_nginx.git
❯ cd easy_nginx
❯ mkdir -p certs/dummy.com
❯ cd certs/dummy.com
❯ openssl genrsa -out privkey.pem 4096
❯ openssl req -new -x509 -key privkey.pem -out fullchain.pem -days 360 -subj /CN=dummy.com
❯ cd -
❯ sudo -- sh -c 'echo "\n127.0.0.1 dummy.com\n" >> /etc/hosts'
❯ docker-compose up -d

# then you can go to your web browser or use curl
❯ curl -k -v https://dummy.com
